VLADIMIR:
We are waiting for
Godot to come—
ESTRAGON:
Ah!
POZZO:
Help!
VLADIMIR:
Or for night to fall. (Pause.) We have kept our appointment and that's an end to that.
We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as
much?
ESTRAGON:
Billions.
VLADIMIR:
You think so?
ESTRAGON:
I don't know.
VLADIMIR:
You may be right.
POZZO:
Help!
VLADIMIR:
All I know is that the hours are long, under these conditions, and constrain us to beguile
them with proceedings which –how shall I say– which may at first sight seem
reasonable, until they become a habit. You may say it is to prevent our reason from
foundering. No doubt. But has it not long been straying in the night without end of the
abyssal depths? That's what I sometimes wonder. You follow my reasoning?
ESTRAGON:
(aphoristic for once). We are all born mad. Some remain so.
POZZO:
Help! I'll pay you!
ESTRAGON:
How much?
POZZO:
One hundred francs!
ESTRAGON:
It's not enough.
VLADIMIR:
I wouldn't go so far as that.
ESTRAGON:
You think it's enough?
VLADIMIR:
No, I mean so far as to assert that I was weak in the head when I came into the world.
But that is not the question.
POZZO:
Two hundred!
VLADIMIR:
We wait. We are bored. (He throws up his hand.) No, don't protest, we are bored to
death, there's no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let
it go to waste. Come, let's get to work! (He advances towards the heap, stops in his
stride.) In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of
nothingness!
